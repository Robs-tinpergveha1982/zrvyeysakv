OMG, just saw Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare, and honestly, it was a whole trip. Like, did they really just do that to Peter? üò≥ I mean, whoever decided this was the next step for the Lost Boys had some insane ideas. I felt like I was watching a fever dream at some points, no joke.

IDK, maybe I'm just tired, but it was like they tried to make the whole thing extra edgy, which kinda worked but also... did it really? You know what I mean? Seriously, Neverland was like, all gloomy and stuff. Not the magical place I remember from when I was a kid. Also, Captain Hook‚ÄîI mean, talk about a serial overactor, right? üòÇ

> And Wendy, oh geez, she was just walking disaster energy all over, and I love her for it. One second she's like, We can do this! the next she's basically ready to doom everyone with some cunning plan... like, girl, chill.

Did you download the movie too or watch it somewhere online? Felt like it would be one of those movies that's better from the comfort of your couch, with a cozy blanket and popcorn from the microwave‚Äîthat real home theater vibe. üçø Honestly, I don't know if it'd be the same experience in a theater full of people who take things a bit too seriously.

At some point, I couldn't decide if I was scared, entertained, or just there for the unintentional comedy. I mean, the flying shadows thing? Kinda iconic but also hilariously overdone, if you ask me.

Just remembered all this makes me think we've been getting tons of these reimagined stories lately, right? It's like every franchise wants to go dark and mysterious these days. Not that I'm complaining! Sometimes it hits the spot, but other times... eeeeh, not so much. But hey, it‚Äôs all good fun.

console.log(Neverland is dark now?!);

Anyway, how have you been doing? Did you see it with anyone, or were you braving the madness solo? üòÅ Speaking of madness, let's just watch something light and fluffy next time. Maybe animated cats that don't transform into monsters halfway through, LOL.
